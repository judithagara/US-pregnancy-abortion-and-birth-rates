### About Data

In this project, I made use of a dataset sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/vizwiz/pregnancy-birth-abortion-rates-in-the-united-states) containing data on Pregnancy, Birth & Abortion Rates per 1000 women in the United States. The data is split by State, Metric and Age Range from 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2005 - 2016.

### Insights
**I considered the following questions in my analysis:**
   - Has the pregnancy, abortion and birth rates increased or receded over the years?
   - What age range has the least and most abortion, pregnancy and birth rates?
   - What state has the least and most abortion, pregnancy and birth rates?
